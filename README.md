## SpotMicro ESP32

This repository is a fork of the code from MaartenWeyn for the SpotMicro ESP32 designed by Michael Kubina.
Dog: https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32
Origin Code: https://github.com/maartenweyn/SpotMicro_ESP32

I hope to push this further. It may take some time.


## App

I might eventually make an app as per the one developed by Maartenweyn in Cordova (https://cordova.apache.org/).

## Code
Code currently uses the following:
ESP-IDF - https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/
ESP-DSP - https://github.com/espressif/esp-dsp
PCA9685 LED PWM Driver - Unknown
